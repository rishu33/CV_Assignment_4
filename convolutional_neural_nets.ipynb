    "## Softmax Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Before considering convolutional neural networks, let us start with a simpler classifier called softmax regression (a.k.a. multinomial logistic regression). Note that even though the name contains \"regression\", this is a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax regression can be understood as a single-layer neural network. We first flatten our input image to a long vector $\\mathbf{x}$, consisting of $32\\cdot 32\\cdot 3 = 3072$ values. Then we predict class probabilities $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ through a fully-connected layer with softmax activation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{z} = W \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b} \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{y}_c = \\operatorname{softmax}(\\mathbf{z})_c = \\frac{\\exp{z_c}}{\\sum_{\\tilde{c}=1}^{10} \\exp{z_{\\tilde{c}}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $z_c$ denotes the $c$th component of the vector $\\mathbf{z}$, called the vector of **logits**.\n",
    "The weights $W$ and biases $\\mathbf{b}$ will be learned during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "We train the model by minimizing a **loss function** averaged over the training data. As we are tackling a classification problem, the **cross-entropy** is a suitable loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{CE}(\\mathbf{y}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}; W, \\mathbf{b}) = - \\sum_{c=1}^{10} y_c \\log{\\hat{y}_c}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the above notation the ground-truth $\\mathbf{y}$ is a so-called **one-hot vector**, containing a single 1 component, while the remaining components \n",
    "are zeros. The model's predicted $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ is a vector which also sums to one, but whose components all take continuous values in the range $(0, 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We minimize the loss by **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD). That is, we repeatedly sample mini-batches from the training data and update the parameters (weights and biases) towards the direction of the steepest decrease of the loss averaged over the mini-batch. For example, the weight $w_{ij}$ (an element of the matrix $W$) is updated according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{ij}^{(t+1)} = w_{ij}^{(t)} - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}_{CE}} {\\partial w_{ij}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\eta$ being the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "To build such a model in PyTorch, we take a `Sequential` module which accepts layers that are applied sequentially. Here we have two layers: `Flatten` converts the image into a long vector and `Linear` is a synonym for fully-connected layer. At the end we would expect a `Softmax` layer, but this has to be omitted since the PyTorch-implementation of cross-entropy already performs the softmax implicitly. If you check the equations above, you see why this is advantageous: the cross-entropy applies a $\\log$ to the $\\exp$ of the softmax, which cancel out. By doing both at once, we avoid unnecessary computations and reduce the risk of numerical issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We further define the function `train_classifier` which performs the training process. These are the main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instantiate a `DataLoader` for each dataset split which shuffles the order of the data and creates minibatches.\n",
    "* Instantiate the `CrossEntropyLoss`. Note, that this loss implicitely computes the softmax.\n",
    "* Iterate over the epochs:\n",
    "  * Do the training loop:\n",
    "    * Pass the image batch through the model.\n",
    "    * Compute the loss.\n",
    "    * Backpropagate the loss (this computes the gradients for each parameter).\n",
    "    * Do an optimizer step (this updates the model parameters).\n",
    "    * Clear the computed gradients.\n",
    "  * Do a testing loop.\n",
    "  \n",
    "During this process, several statistics (loss/accuracy for train/test) are computed, printed and written to TensorBoard. The function also supports specifying a learning rate scheduler, which we will use at the end of this exercise."

    "In CNNs, the multiple input channels of a conv layer are not handled independently, but are linearly combined. This means that the weight array has shape `[out_channels, in_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width]` and we perform a weighted sum along the input channel axis. Another difference is the use of a **bias** vector of shape `[out_channels]`, each components gets added to the corresponding output channel.\n",

Further, the weight values are shared between the different pixel locations.\n",

Each feature channel is normalized to have zero mean and unit variance across the spatial and mini-batch axes. To compensate for the lost degrees of freedom, extra scaling and bias parameters are introduced and learned. Mathematically, BatchNorm for a spatial feature map (e.g. the output of conv) can be written as:\n",

To obtain the fixed values for test-time use, one needs to maintain moving statistics over the activations during training. This can be a bit tricky to implement from scratch, but luckily this is now implemented in all popular frameworks, including PyTorch.\n",

    "## Residual Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet is a more modern architecture, introduced by He et al. in 2015 (published in 2016: https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) and is still popular today.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of blocks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ResNet Block](resnet_block.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these so-called *residual blocks* only have to predict a *residual* (in plain words: the \"rest\", the \"leftover\") that will be added on top of its input.\n",
    "In other words, the block outputs how much each feature needs to be changed in order to enhance the representation compared to the previous block.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to combine residual blocks into *residual networks* (ResNets). In the following, we consider ResNet-v1, as used for the CIFAR-10 benchmark in the original ResNet paper (it is simpler compared to the full model that they used for the much larger ImageNet benchmark).\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 4.2. of the paper describes this architecture as follows: \"*The first layer is 3×3 convolutions. Then we use a stack of 6n layers with 3×3 convolutions on the feature maps of sizes {32, 16, 8} respectively, with 2n layers for each feature map size. The numbers of filters are {16, 32, 64} respectively. The subsampling is performed by convolutions with a stride of 2. The network ends with a global average pooling, a 10-way fully-connected layer, and softmax. [...] When shortcut connections are used, they are connected to the pairs of 3×3 layers (totally 3n shortcuts). On this dataset we use identity shortcuts in all cases.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, they use L2 regularization for training (a standard tool to combat overfitting). This penalizes weights with large magnitude by adding an additional term to the cost function, besides the cross-entropy. The overall function to optimize becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{CE} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{w\\in\\text{weights}} w^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and in this paper $\\lambda=10^{-4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the explanation above to complete the `layers`-list in the `ResNet`-class below. Note, that the first layer is already added and remember that the final softmax has to be omitted. The `ResNetBlock` already implements the above figure, i.e. contains $2$ convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight decay is already added by setting the corresponding attribute of the opimizer."
